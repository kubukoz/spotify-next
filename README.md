A small program making it easier to filter out music on Spotify.

## Installation

1. Create an application in the Spotify API dashboard. Add a redirect URI pointing to `http://localhost:4321/login`.
The port `4321` is configured in the `.spotify-next.json` config file (see [usage](#usage)).

1. `sbt stage`

## Usage

The application requires some configuration (e.g. the client ID for the Spotify Web API).
It's stored in a file at `~/.spotify-next.json`.
When you first run the application, or if that file is deleted, the application will ask and attempt to create one.

The configuration defines the port for the embedded HTTP server used for authentication. The server server will only start when the login flow is triggered, and stop afterwards.

```
$ ./target/universal/stage/bin/spotify-next --help

Usage:
    spotify-next login
    spotify-next skip
    spotify-next drop
    spotify-next forward
    spotify-next s
    spotify-next d
    spotify-next f
    spotify-next repl

You can run the login command to be prompted for authorization, or you can rely on the fallback mechanism of all API calls - when one fails with 401 Unauthorized, you'll see the response and be prompted to log in. The call will be retried once after you successfully log in.

The application automatically saves the token to the configuration file after successful logins.
